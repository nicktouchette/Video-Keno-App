##How To Play

The default credit amount the player starts with is 80.

1. Select 4 to 10 spaces at a time by clicking them.
2. Place a bet using the "bet up", "bet down", and "bet max" buttons.
3. Begin the round with Start.

The game draws 20 unique random numbers and places them on the board individually.

If your numbers selected match the numbers drawn, depending on how many you've selected and how many you matched, you will be rewarded the payout as dictated by the payout table on the right.

You can no longer play after your credit amount has hit 0.  Refresh the page to start over with 80 more credits.

##To Do

A 'gold coin' mini game needs to be implemented so that when 2 of your gold coins are selected, the multiplier is used.  If 3 of the coins are selected, it will go into a mini game where you're awarded free games.
